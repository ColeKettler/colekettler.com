        <p>I'm a fermentation enthusiast and regularly make my own beer, kombucha, and pickles. I'm a lover of food and an avid cook, and I particularly enjoy Sichuan, Punjabi, Thai, French, and Southern Italian food. There isn't much food out there that I don't enjoy. üç≤</p>
        <p>I enjoy board games and tabletop RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons. I'm always delighted to sit down for a game with friendly folks. üé≤</p>
